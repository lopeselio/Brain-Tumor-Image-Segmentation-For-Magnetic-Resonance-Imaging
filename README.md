#### Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 

It is an advanced imaging technique that is used to observe a variety of diseases and parts of the body.
Neural networks can analyze these images individually (as a radiologist would) or combine them into a single 3D volume to make predictions.
At a high level, MRI works by measuring the radio waves emitting by atoms subjected to a magnetic field.
